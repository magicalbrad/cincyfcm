## Who are we?

<img src="/img/audience2.jpg" class="alignright" alt="Audience members clapping">

The Greater Cincinnati Fellowship of Christian Magicians is a group of Christians in Greater Cincinnati. We share the gospel through visual illustrations and help others develop their talent for gospel presentation using sleight of hand, optical illusion, ventriloquism, puppets, balloons, clowning, juggling, storytelling, and other visual arts.

## What do we do?

Each month, we get together to pray, laugh, share ideas, and try out new routines. If you have an interest in using magic and other visual arts in ministry, then come and join us.

## When do we meet?

The Greater Cincinnati Fellowship of Christian Magicians meets the 2nd Tuesday of each month at 7PM. Meetings are held at the [Haines House of Cards](http://hainesmagicshop.com/).
